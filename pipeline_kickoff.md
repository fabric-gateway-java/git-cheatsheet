# Pipeline Verify Job

This document explains how to create Jenkins pipeline verify and merge jobs with simple configuration changes. The steps shown in this document explain how to create a new pipeline verify or merge job.

The below pipeline verify job template is a starting point but we recommend creating your own to ensure that the jobs configured reflect the projectâ€™s needs.

## Job Templates

### Pipeline Verify Job

```
- pipeline_verify: &pipeline_verify
    name: pipeline-verify

    project-type: pipeline
    concurrent: true
    pipeline-scm:
      script-path: '{jenkins_file}'
      scm:
        - git:
            credentials-id: 'hyperledger-jobbuilder'
            url: '$GIT_BASE'
            shallow-clone: true
            refspec: $GERRIT_REFSPEC:$GERRIT_REFSPEC
            wipe-workspace: true
            clean:
              before: true
              after: true
            branches:
              - $GERRIT_REFSPEC

    parameters:
      - project-parameter:
          project: '{project}'
      - gerrit-parameter:
          branch: 'master'
      - gerrit-refspec-parameter:
          refspec: '$GERRIT_REFSPEC'

    properties:
      - fabric-pipeline-properties:
          job-type: '{job_type}'
          build-node: 'hyp-{build_node}'
      - build-discarder:
          days-to-keep: 10
          artifact-days-to-keep: 7

    triggers:
      - gerrit-trigger-patch-submitted:
          name: '{project}'
          branch: '{branch}'
          trigger-comment1: 'reverify$'
          trigger-comment2: 'reverify-{build_node}$'

- job-template:
    name: '{project}-verify-{arch}'
    id: fab-pipeline-verify
<<: *pipeline_verify
```

**Template Names:**    - '{project}-verify-{arch}'

**Names:**             - fabric-samples-verify-x86_64

**Comment Trigger:**   - Trigger the verify jobs by posting a comment phrase `reverify` and `reverify-x` or `reverify-z` etc.. based on the value you provided to `build_node`

**Required parameters:**

    project: fabric-samples  - Project Name
    branch: ''               - Branch Name ex: master/release-1.4 (If you would like to trigger jobs on any branch keep this as default)
    arch: 'x86_64'           - Arch to run builds on.
    build_node: 'x'          - Build node label names (hyp-x is for x86_64 build nodes, hyp-z is for s390x build nodes)
    job_type: 'verify'       - Specify the which job type it is. verify is to trigger the verify job
    jenkins_file: Jenkinsfile- Specify the Jenkinsfile name here. Change this value if you are using a different file name. 

**Optional parameters:**

    $GIT_BASE        - GIT_BASE is a custom jenkins environment variable defined in Jenkins with `gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/$PROJECT`
    $PROJECT         - PROJECT is a custom jenkins environment variable defined in Jenkins with the project name. ex: fabric-samples
    $GERRIT_REFSPEC  - GERRIT_REFSPEC is a Jenkins environment variable provides the gerrit patchset reference number 

**Global Environment Variables**

See this file for reference https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/jenkins-config/global-vars-production.sh
    
## Macros

**gerrit-trigger-patch-submitted**

  - This macro triggers a jenkins job when a `patchset-created-event` is triggered
  - It won't trigger the job when a commit message is updated in the gerrit patchset.
  - Triggers the jobs when a comment is posted in the gerrit patchset. Comments are specified in the job configuration.
  - It triggers the job on a branch pattren specified in the job configuration.

**fabric-pipeline-properties** : This macro provides the below environment variables in each job type. These variables can be accessed by `env.<ParameterName>` in Jenkinsfile. ex: `env.JOB_TYPE`

### How to create a new pipeline verify job:

The above template is a base for any pipeline verify jobs. Use the below configuration in your project directory under jjb folder and modify the below parameters based on your project need. Please make sure the jenkins node label is available and name of the jenkins_file. NOTE: Don't modify the `fab-pipeline-verify` as it is a `id` specified to the pipeline verify job. This `id` will be used in across all the pipeline verify job with pre-configured jenkins job configuration.

```
---
- project:
    name: fabric-<project_name>-verify-jobs
    jobs:
      - 'fab-pipeline-verify'

    project: <project_name>
    branch: ''
    arch: 'x86_64'
    build_node: 'x'
    job_type: 'verify'
    jenkins_file: Jenkinsfile
```

After you prepare the new pipeline verify job configuration, it creates a new job name as `fabric-<project_name>-verify-<arch>` ex: `fabric-samples-verify-x86_64` follow this document https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/Sandbox_Setup.md#to-test-a-job to test the newly created job and push to sandbox for testing. After your changes and testing is done, push this change to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/ci-management repository add reviewers in the patchset and post the same in the #ci-pipeline RocketChat channel for quick response.

Once your patch is verified and reviewed, the patch will get merged by CI maintainers and then further it updates in the Production Jenkins Configuration. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/

### Pipeline Merge Job

Follow the same approach for the pipeline merge job. All you have to do is, copy the below code snippet in your project directory under jjb.

**Template Names:**    - '{project}-merge-{arch}'

**Names:**             - <project_name>-merge-x86_64

**Merge Template**

```
- pipeline_merge: &pipeline_merge
    name: pipeline-merge

    project-type: pipeline
    concurrent: true
    pipeline-scm:
      script-path: '{jenkins_file}'
      scm:
        - git:
            credentials-id: 'hyperledger-jobbuilder'
            url: '$GIT_BASE'
            shallow-clone: true
            refspec: +refs/heads/$GERRIT_BRANCH:refs/remotes/origin/$GERRIT_BRANCH'
            wipe-workspace: true
            clean:
              before: true
              after: true
            branches:
              - refs/heads/$GERRIT_BRANCH

    parameters:
      - project-parameter:
          project: '{project}'
      - gerrit-parameter:
          branch: 'master'
      - gerrit-refspec-parameter:
          refspec: 'refs/heads/$GERRIT_BRANCH'

    properties:
      - fabric-pipeline-properties:
          job-type: '{job_type}'
          build-node: 'hyp-{build_node}'
      - build-discarder:
          days-to-keep: 10
          artifact-days-to-keep: 7

    triggers:
      - gerrit-trigger-patch-merged:
          name: '{project}'
          branch: '{branch}'
          trigger-comment1: 'remerge$'
          trigger-comment2: 'remerge-{build_node}$'

- job-template:
    name: '{project}-merge-{arch}'
    id: fab-pipeline-merge
<<: *pipeline_merge
```

## Macros

**gerrit-trigger-patch-merged**

  - This macro triggers a jenkins job when a `change-merged-event` is triggered
  - It won't trigger the job when a commit message is updated in the gerrit patchset.
  - Triggers the jobs when a comment is posted in the gerrit patchset. Comments are specified in the job configuration.
  - It triggers the job on a branch pattren specified in the job configuration.
  
 **Comment Trigger:**   - Trigger the verify jobs by posting a comment phrase `remerge` and `remerge-x` or `remerge-z` etc.. based on the value you provided to `build_node`

**Merge Job configuration**

```
---
- project:
    name: fabric-<project_name>-merge-jobs
    jobs:
      - 'fab-pipeline-merge'

    project: <project_name>
    branch: ''
    arch: 'x86_64'
    build_node: 'x'
    job_type: 'merge'
    jenkins_file: Jenkinsfile
```
